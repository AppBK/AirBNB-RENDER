## Introduction

 Hey Now!! This is the beginning of my 'Clone AirBNB' Project! I hope you will enjoy watching as it evolves!
 
## Technologies
 
 The technologies used in this project are Express/Sequelize on the backend and React/Redux on the front end.

## Local Startup

 1. cd into the backend folder and run 'npm start' to spin up the API!
 2. cd into the frontend folder and spin up React using 'npm start'
 3. Note that at this point the app should open on it's own inside of your default browser. If for some reason this fails, try opening 'http://localhost:3000' in your browser.
 4. Enjoy!
